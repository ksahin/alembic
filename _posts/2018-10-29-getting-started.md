### Importing your products

Importing your own products is the first step to set up your account. There are many ways to add your own product catalog, depending on the eCommerce plateform you use. You can either use one of our integrations, or a CSV upload. 

##### Adding with the Shopify Integration

If you have a Shopify store you can use our one-click integration to import your catalog. Just fill the form with your shopify store URL. If you have tens of thousands of products, this step can take several minutes. 

##### Importing a CSV file

You can import your product catalog with the CSV import feature in two simple steps. First click on the upload button. Once you've uploaded your CSV, you need to match your CSV fields to PricingBot's fields:

The only mandatory field is your product URL, so that PricingBot crawlers can extract your product information from your store / marketplace. 

##### Importing a single product

You can also use the form to import a single product. This is useful for marketplace sellers who have several products on different marketplaces. 

### Adding competitors

Now that you have imported your own products, it's time to add some competitors. 
For each products you have, you can add many competitors with different methods:

##### Modal on a product detail
