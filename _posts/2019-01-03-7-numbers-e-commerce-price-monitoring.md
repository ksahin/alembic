Here are 10 numbers that should make you really understand how important pricing is. Here at [PricingBot](https://www.pricingbot.co) we strongly believe that pricing should be a significant, if not, the most significant part of your strategy.
Over the last years, we have built great pricing related products that e-commerce stores owner love and we want to share with you what we think are 10 numbers about pricing that you should know.

#### 63 % of people are here to compare product prices.

According to a recent PWC study, 61% of people visiting e-commerce websites are here to check prices whereas only 9% are looking for ideas.

Suggestions are great and can significantly improve your average ticket/basket size, but do not forget that the customer will first and foremost look at the price. (1)

#### 3 is the number of time your competitor will change his prices per quarter.

Analyzing more than 1 million data points we discovered that on average a product price change approximately one time per month. But we also notice that more than 10% of the websites we monitor change their prices almost 1 time per week (3.7 times per month), on 50% of our client change their price with the same frequency. Those are the store that already understands the importance of pricing and of having [price monitoring tools](https://www.pricingbot.co) that automates the whole process.

#### 65% of Consumers Look Up Price Comparisons on Mobile While in a Physical Store

While this might not seem important if you run an pure player e-commerce store it highlights the fact that people do really care about pricing. And be sure that if someone sees on your store a product 10% cheaper than the one they are currently holding in their hands in a physical one, they are much more likely to spend money in your business. (2) See by yourself:

#### 34% of people buying from your store matched price online just prior to the purchase.

Approximately 1 out of 3 buyers will have seen your product because they were checking the price online. It is more than the number people that will make a purchase just after having seen an ad online (30%). Here again you can see that having a powerful and efficient pricing strategy can be as efficient as having effective ads. Of course, advertising should not be underestimated but be sure to measure the whole importance of your pricing strategy too. (3)

#### 1st attribute when deciding where to buy if pricing.

When asked about what is the most important attributes for deciding where to buy 36% of people answered pricing, whereas only 14% chose stock availability and 1% return policy. Once again it shows that pricing matters, and it matters a lot. (2)

#### It can take up to 120 hours a month to efficiently monitor 300 product.

[Price monitoring](https://www.pricingbot.co) takes time, we calculated that checking prices can take up to 40 hours for small size e-commerce with 100 skus and two competitors for each of their products. This is why we developed our solution that allows you to automatically track all your competitorâ€™s products prices while only spending 2 minutes setting up your account.

#### 20% of people leave checkout because they found the product cheaper elsewhere.
